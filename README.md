# Weyl_phonons_IFC_model_2024
These files are supplemental data for the article "Nonlocality and Strength of Interatomic Interactions Inducing the Topological Phonon Phase Transition", including results of Berry curvature, WCC evolutions, and visualized eigenstates of Weyl phonons.

The names of files or folders are determined based on the contents contained within them. For example, KVFF_AlN_nominal_3NN_ε=10ε0_band4&5 refers to the phonon eigenstates of AlN predicted by the KVFF model with nominal 3NN interactions, where ε=10ε0. And this Weyl point is the crossing point between bands 4 and 5.
